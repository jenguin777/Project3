# YumBot - A Personal Digital Cookbook

YumBot allows the user to create an inventory of ingredients on hand, then submit a search to the Recipe Puppy API to return recipes that include one or more of those ingredients. Users can "favorite" API recipes to have them saved to their own Favorite Recipes Page. They can also save and edit their own recipes via their own Personal Recipes Page. Once saved, the recipes can be printed, emailed or shared via Twitter.
